# Computer-Vision-System
My Second AiCore Project was to create a computer vision system. It detects whether a user is showing rock, paper or scissors to the camera.

Using [Teachabe-Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image), I first created the model. The model was created by four different classes, corresponding to rock, paper, scissors or nothing.

I then downloaded the model file. These contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learaning model. 

`keras_model.h5` and `labels.txt`

These files do not run.
